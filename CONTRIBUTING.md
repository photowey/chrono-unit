Welcome to `Chronounit`! This document is a guideline about how to contribute to `Chronounit`.

If you find something incorrect or missing, please leave comments / suggestions.


## Before you get started

### Code of Conduct

Please make sure to read and observe our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

#### Begin your contribution

Now if you want to contribute, please create a new pull request.

We use the `dev` branch as the development branch, which indicates that this is an unstable branch.

Now, if you are ready to create PR, here is the `workflow` for contributors:

1.  Fork to your own
    
2.  Clone fork to a local repository
    
3.  Create a new branch and work on it
    
4.  Keep your branch in sync
    
5.  Commit your changes (make sure your commit message is concise)
    
6.  Push your commits to your forked repository
    
7.  Create a pull request to **`dev`** branch.



When creating pull request:

1.  Please follow **Normal PR template**
    
2.  Please create the request to **`dev`**  branch.
    
3.  Please make sure the PR has a corresponding issue.
    
4.  If your PR contains large changes, `e.g.` component `refactor` or new components, please write detailed documents about its design and usage.
    
5.  Note that a single PR should not be too large. If heavy changes are required, it's better to separate the changes to a few individual `PRs`.
    
6.  After creating a PR, one or more reviewers will be assigned to the pull request.
    
7.  Before merging a PR, squash any fix review feedback, typo, merged and `rebased` sorts of commits. The final commit message should be clear and concise.


`Notes`: 

If your PR contains large changes, `e.g.` component `refactor` or new components, please write detailed documents about its design and usage.
